VAMOS CONTAR

This page is part of a sequence of five exercises done in the CURSO DE JAVA SCRIPT of the CURSO EM V√çDEO channel of Professor Gustavo Guanabara. This course was very useful to start learning how to edit CSS inside JavaScript functions.

Although simple, this course was very didactic to learn the concepts that were proposed.

This third exercise has as input a start number, an end number and a step value, giving as result a numerical sequence between start and end, with an interval equal to the step.
